## Problem Dscription

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return _indices of the two numbers such that they add up to `target`._

You may assume that each input would have \_**exactly one solution**\_\_, adn you may not use the same element twwice.

You can return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [0,1]
```

**Explanation:**
Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [3,2,4], target = 6
Output: [1,2]
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: nums = [3,3], target = 6
Output: [0,1]
```

## Constraints

- `2 <= nums.length <= 100^4`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
